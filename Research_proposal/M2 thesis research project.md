Dissertation title: Machine Learning approach to the DSGE modeling

The dissertation will consist of the adaptation of the Machine Learning software stack to the estimation of the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model in the framework of the small open economy with frictions on the financial and labor markets. 

More specifically, the dissertation will start with the comprehensive summary of the current trends in the DSGE estimation, with particular emphasis on the importance of the inclusion of financial and unemployment frictions. The analysis of the growing literature of business cycle fluctuations models will allow to choose one specific model, potentially the mix of the most renowned models, possibly extended by the author by adding another aspects or by contrary simplified in order to grasp the main ideas and still remain relatively medium in size and complexity.

The next step will incorporate solving of the selected model and then log-linearizing its solution around the steady steady. Subsequently, parameter estimation based on the representation of the equilibrium from the previous stage will be performed by implementing the maximum likelihood procedure. The author will heavily use the Python Deep Learning libraries as TensorFlow or PyTorch in order to make use of their automatic differentiation feature and compare their efficiency and time complexity with the classical DSGE estimation implementations.

Finally, the author hopes to explore other efficient estimation procedures, which exploit the efficiency of vectorization on Deep Learning architecture.
